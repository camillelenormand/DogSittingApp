# Dog Sitting App

## Instructions

Create a data model from the following instructions:

There is a dogsitter model and a dog model (you can choose at least one attribute for each). A dogsitter can walk several dogs during a stroll, and a dog can have several dogsitters through strolls.

Now, you want to specify the city of the dogsitters and dogs to create a great matching algorithm. Therefore, you will need to create a City model with the attribute city_name. Each city contains several dogsitters and dogs, but a dog and a dogsitter can only belong to one city.
